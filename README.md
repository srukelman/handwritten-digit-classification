## Configuration
This project was written 100% in python, using the following libraries and versions:
```
Python:  3.11.1
TensorFlow:  2.12.0
scikit-learn:  1.2.2
Pandas:  2.0.2
NumPy:  1.23.5
MatPlotLib:  3.7.1
```

## Data Overview
Before getting into the classification, it is important to understand the data we are working with. The data provided is a set of 1797 handwritten digits that have been taken and converted to 8x8 images and each labeled with the number they should be. For example, this is what one 7 in the set looks like.
